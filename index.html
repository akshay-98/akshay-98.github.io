            <h3>How it works?</h3>
          <p>Image recognition and Accelerometer</p>
	<span id="more2">
		A user while traveling with the application running helps to gather data for the specific route they 
		are traversing. Data is gathered using the Image recognition software running on the application as well as
		cross validating it with the accelerometer recordings. This helps gather accurate readings for that route and
		is stored in a database for future use. The next time another user is traversing the same route this data is served
		to them so they can make informed decisions regarding the route to select to reach their destination.
